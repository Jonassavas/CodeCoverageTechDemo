# CodeCoverageTechDemo
This is a technical demonstration for the master's thesis that involves running code coverage tools on a Java open-source repository and documenting the results in a report. The chosen repository is [ZXing](https://github.com/zxing/zxing) which is an android application written in Java to scan barcodes and QR codes.

## Report
The report includes further details about the assignment, its execution and the results, and can be found [here](./Technical_Demo_Report__Jonas_Sävås.pdf).

## Code Coverage Results
In order to investigate the results of the generated code coverage tools I would advise opening the respective `index.html` locally to see an overview and navigate through the classes.

### [JaCoCo](./RESULTS/JaCoCo/)

### [IntelliJ](./RESULTS/IntelliJ%20CodeCoverage/htmlReport/)

### [Cobertura (unused)](./RESULTS/cobertura_unusable/)

## Built JAR-files
The JAR-files built for the instructed coverage tools that unfortunately did not end up working within the time frame can be found here:

### [Yajta](./JAR_files/yajta/)

### [JCov](./JAR_files/jcov.jar)
